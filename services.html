        <h2>Circle of Security Parenting Program</h2>

        <img class="service" src="/images/services/kids.jpg" />

        <p>This 8-week program is based on decades of research that promotes a secure parent-child relationship. It
            focuses on understanding your child and how to look beyond their behaviours so that you can respond to their
            underlying needs. In each two-hour session, you will have the opportunity to develop specific relationships
            capacities that allow your child to thrive and develop healthy relationships now and in the future.</p>

        <h2>Tuning in to Kids</h2>

        <img class="service" src="/images/services/beach.jpg" />

        <p>This evidence-based program teaches emotion coaching skills to parents, carers, or adults working with
            children in a school or community setting. You will develop skills in understanding and managing children's
            emotions, and how to respond supportively. This strengthens connections and improves children's emotional
            regulation and behaviour. Delivery of program material and facilitation of group discussion takes place for
            two hours per week, over six weeks.</p>

        <h2>Tuning in to Teens</h2>

            and extend the skills that you already have to facilitate healthy communication with adolescents in the
            family, school or community setting. This encourages teens to understand and express their own emotions in
            healthy ways to maximise their social, behavioural, cognitive and physiological outcomes. Delivery of
            program material and facilitation of group discussion takes place for two hours per week, over six weeks.
        </p>


        <h1>Wellbeing Programs</h1>

        <h2>Body Intelligence</h2>

        <img class="service" src="/images/services/body.jpg" />

        <p>Body Intelligence (BQ) workshops provide an opportunity for participants to develop a deeper awareness of
            their physical and emotional states, while promoting a healthy relationship with their body. Through
            increased awareness of the body's signals, needs and emotions, participants are supported to improve their
            mental and physical health. We explore the idea of Body Image and the impact of social media and social
            standards on self-esteem. Time is dedicated to the facilitation of mindful practices that can be woven
            throughout the day, promoting long-term positive change. Workshop delivery is flexible and contains eight
            hours of content (e.g. two hours per week over four weeks).</p>

            matters most. You can play a vital role in reducing stigma and promoting pathways to support for those
            experiencing mental health problems in our workplaces, communities, schools, and tertiary institutions.
            Training is delivered over two days, six hours per day.</p>
